# ElizaOS

> ElizaOS is a comprehensive framework for building AI agents with persistent personalities across multiple platforms. It provides the architecture, tools, and systems to create sophisticated agents that maintain consistent behavior, learn from interactions, and seamlessly integrate with various services.

ElizaOS allows developers to create autonomous AI agents that can operate across multiple platforms while maintaining a consistent personality and knowledge base. The framework handles the complexities of state management, conversation context, and platform-specific integration, letting developers focus on defining agent behavior.
